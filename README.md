# clojure-noob

**clojure-noob** is nothing fancy. It's just a starter Clojure project make to learn how to use Leiningen and what the folder structure looks like. I'm going through [*Clojure for the Brave and True*](https://www.braveclojure.com/foreword/) (again, third time's a charm) and this is the initial project.
